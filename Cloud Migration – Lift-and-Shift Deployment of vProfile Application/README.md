# Cloud Migration – Lift-and-Shift Deployment of vProfile Application

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **Lift-and-Shift cloud migration** of the **vProfile monolithic application** to **AWS**.  
The goal is to migrate the application **as-is** from a traditional environment to the cloud without modifying the application code, focusing on **cloud infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and operations**.

This project simulates a **real-world Cloud Operations (CloudOps) scenario** commonly handled by CloudOps and Cloud Infrastructure engineers.

---

## Project Objectives
- Migrate a monolithic application to AWS using the Lift-and-Shift strategy
- Design and deploy a production-like AWS infrastructure
- Configure networking, security, compute, and database services
- Ensure application availability and operational stability
- Follow AWS best practices for cloud operations

---

## Architecture Overview
The application is deployed on AWS using the following architecture:

- **EC2 instances** to host application services
- **Load Balancer** to distribute traffic
- **Security Groups** for network-level access control
- **RDS** for managed database services
- **Private & Public subnets** for isolation and security
- **IAM roles** for secure access management

---

## AWS Services Used
- Amazon EC2
- Elastic Load Balancer (ALB)
- Amazon RDS
- Amazon VPC
- Security Groups
- IAM
- Route Tables

---

## Deployment Strategy
- Migration type: **Lift-and-Shift (Rehost)**
- Application code was not modified
- Infrastructure was rebuilt on AWS
- Services were configured to match production-like behavior

---

## Key Responsibilities Demonstrated
- Cloud infrastructure provisioning
- Networking configuration (VPC, subnets, routing)
- Security configuration (Security Groups, IAM)
- Deployment and validation of services
- Operational readiness and troubleshooting

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- AWS Cloud Operations
- Cloud Migration
- Infrastructure Management
- Networking & Security
- Linux Server Administration
- Troubleshooting & Validation

---

## Project Classification
- **Primary:** Cloud Operations (CloudOps)
- **Secondary:** Cloud Migration, AWS Infrastructure
